\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}

In this thesis, we have presented 

The main contributions of this thesis are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We are the first to present a new technique 
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

There are a number of interesting future work possibilities, both in the short term and further into the future.

In the future, we will explore: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Applications}: we aim to apply our system to real-time intrusion detection and statistical debugging.
	\item \textbf{Analysis}: we wish to define ``real-time'' data analysis techniques for traces and instrumentation done in \parikshan.
	\item \textbf{Optimize Live Cloning}: We plan to reduce the suspend time of live cloning, by utilizing several recent works in live migration.
\end{itemize}
