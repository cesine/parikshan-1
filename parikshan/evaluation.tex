\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:parikshanEvaluation}

To evaluate the performance of \parikshan, we pose and answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} How long does it take to create a live clone of a production container and what is it's impact on the performance of the production container?\\
\item \textbf{RQ2:} What is the size of the debugging window, and how does it depend on resource constraints?\\ 
\item \textbf{RQ3:} Can we generalize the results of our case study to see if \parikshan can target even more real bugs?
\end{itemize}

We evaluated the \textbf{internal mode} on two identical VM's with an Intel i7 CPU, with 4 Cores, and 16GB RAM each in the same physical host (one each for production and debug containers).
We evaluated the \textbf{external mode} on two identical host nodes with Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 8GB of RAM.
All evaluations were performed on CentOS 6.5.

%In Section~\ref{sec:performance}, we evaluate live cloning on real-world applications and workloads as well as a micro-benchmark to understand its performance in different scenarios.
%In Section~\ref{sec:timewindowPerformance}, we first provide debug-window sizes for varying workloads run on a live production system. 
%For a more systematic understanding of the debug-window size, we also provide simulation results to show the relationship of buffer overflow with buffer size, the incoming workload, and the instrumentation overhead.
%Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:survey}, we present a survey of 217 real-world bugs, picked from three different applications.
%\xxx{What is the environment we evaluated in? Hardware? Software? Why do we have both real and simulated data?}

\subsection{Live Cloning Performance}
\label{sec:parikshanPerformance}

As explained in Section \ref{sec:design}, a short suspend time during live cloning is necessary to ensure that both containers are in the exact same system state.
The suspend time during live cloning can be divided in 4 parts: 
(1) Suspend \& Dump: time taken to pause and dump the container, 
(2) Pcopy after suspend: time required to complete rsync operation 
(3) Copy Dump File: time taken to copy an initial dump file.
(4) Undump \& Resume: time taken to resume the containers. 
To evaluate ``live cloning'', we ran a micro-benchmark of I/O operations, and evaluated live-cloning on some real-world applications running real-workloads.
