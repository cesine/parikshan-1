\section{Summary}
\label{sec:parikshanSummary}

\parikshan is a novel framework that uses redundant cloud resources to debug production SOA applications in real-time.
Compared to existing monitoring solutions, which have focused on reducing instrumentation overhead, our tool decouples instrumentation from the production container.
This allows for high level instrumentation, without impacting user experience.

We demonstrated a proof of concept live cloning process, and were able to show that the impact on network bandwidth was less than 0.5\% and for network latency was less than 0.3\%. 
We also ran \parikshan on some real world workloads on systems like \emph{Wikipedia} to show it's real world applicability.

%We have made \parikshan prototype tool available on GitHub for use by other researchers and practitioners.

%For each of the 16 faults studied in our case study, we have also created a docker containers for most of our experiments, and in the rest we have left a detailed README of the install instructions, and the bug trigger mechanism.
%An extended version of the paper is present in CUCS Tech Reports~\cite{parikshanTR,parikshanQueue}, details about the project, and source code is available on github~\cite{github}. 
%Kaiser is funded in part by NSF CCF-1302269 and CCF-1161079.
