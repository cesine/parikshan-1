\section{Applications: Active Debugging}
\label{sec:guided}

\iffalse
As discussed earlier, \parikshan will allow developers to have higher magnitude of instrumentation, making it easier to capture the causal flow and root causes of the problem.
However, this does not mean that an arbitrarily high amount of instrumentation can be used.
%In this section we explore automated techniques and guidelines to assist developers in using \parikshan for debugging their application.
%In this section, we explain adaptive instrumentation techniques which can help guide the debugger, while keeping the instrumentation within a pre-defined budget.
In this section we discuss how existing statistical debugging techniques can be applied to effectively isolate non-crashing bugs, using the budget limits described in the previous section.
